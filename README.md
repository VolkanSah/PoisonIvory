|---------------|------------------------------|  
| Nmap          | Aggressive port scanning     |  
| Nuclei        | Vulnerability detection      |  
| SSLScan       | TLS/SSL configuration audit  |

- Comprehensive JSON reporting for forensic analysis  
- **Anti-loop mechanisms** for Tor circuit renewal  

---

## Requirements  

### Mandatory  
- Python 3.9+  
- Linux environment (Kernel 5.4+ recommended)  
- Root privileges for nuclear mode operations  

### Security Tools (Partial List)  
```bash
# Core dependencies
sudo apt install nmap nikto sslscan testssl.sh

# Python modules
pip3 install requests stem scapy
```

> **Expert Notice**  
> No automatic dependency checks are included - this is intentional. You are expected to:  
> 1. Understand your environment  
> 2. Install necessary tools  
> 3. Resolve errors through analysis  
> 4. Modify configurations for your operational needs  

---

## Configuration  

### Example `cms_security_config.json`  
```json
{
  "domain": "yourdomain.com",
  "onion_address": "youronionaddress.onion",
  "tor_control_port": 9051,
  "tor_password": "your_tor_password",
  "output_dir": "security_reports",
  "alert_threshold": 5,
  "malicious_relays": ["ABCD1234EFGH5678", "IJKL91011MNOP1213"],
  "malicious_patterns": ["(?i)(malware|exploit|ransomware)", "(?i)(wp-admin|phpmyadmin)"],
  "nuclear_mode": false
}
```

> **Note**: The configuration now supports the `nuclear_mode` option for enabling high-intensity operations.

---

## Usage  

### Command Structure (Preserved Original Interface)  
```bash
python3 PoisonIvory.py [COMMAND] <config_file>
```

### Operations  
| Command       | Function                                  |  
|---------------|-------------------------------------------|  
| `scan`        | Run full security audit                   |  
| `monitor`     | Start continuous monitoring               |  
| `create-config`| Generate default configuration file      |  

### Nuclear Mode Activation  
Enable `nuclear_mode` in your configuration file for high-intensity operations. When enabled, PoisonIvory will:  
- Increase network buffer sizes (requires root)  
- Use aggressive scanning parameters (`-T5 --min-rate 5000`)  
- Allocate additional system resources  
- Reduce monitoring intervals  

Example warning at startup:  
```text
!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
!! NUCLEAR MODE ACTIVATED - EXPECT SYSTEM INSTABILITY !!
!!    Target servers may experience disruption       !!
!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
```

### Examples  
**Run security audit:**  
```bash
python3 PoisonIvory.py scan config.json
```

**Start continuous monitoring:**  
```bash
python3 PoisonIvory.py monitor config.json
```

**Generate default configuration:**  
```bash
python3 PoisonIvory.py create-config
```

**Nuclear Mode Example (edit config first):**  
```json
{
  ...,
  "nuclear_mode": true
}
```

## Design Philosophy  

PoisonIvory embodies three core principles:  

1. **Expert-Centric**  
   - No GUIs, no hand-holding, no "easy mode"  
   - Raw terminal output and JSON reports only  
   - Errors are learning opportunities, not bugs to be automatically fixed  

2. **Original Architecture Preserved**  
   - Nuclear Fusion Edition maintains Volkan's original code structure  
   - Critical security fixes integrated without over-engineering  
   - Seamless upgrade path for existing users  

3. **Offense-Informed**  
   - Adversary-emulating techniques  
   - Threshold-based automatic countermeasures  
   - Tor circuit warfare capabilities with anti-loop protection
