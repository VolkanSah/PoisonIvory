# PoisonIvory - Nemesis (Nuclear) Version 2025 
### Advanced Security & Threat Monitoring Framework  

**Enterprise-grade offensive security platform by Volkan Sah**  
> [!WARNING]  
> Professional Use Only - Handle With Extreme Care!  
> This tool is designed for **experienced security professionals and red teams**. It provides a battle-tested framework for infrastructure hardening, threat detection, and offensive security research.  
> **PoisonIvory is not for script kiddies!** It intentionally requires deep technical knowledge to operate effectively. Expect to troubleshoot missing dependencies, analyze raw outputs, and interpret security events.

## Usage  

### Command Structure  
```bash
./PoisonIvory.py --config <config.json> [OPERATION] [OPTIONS]
```

### Operations  
| Command       | Function                                  |  
|---------------|-------------------------------------------|  
| `--audit`     | Full security audit of configured targets |  
| `--monitor`   | Continuous threat monitoring              |  
| `--nuclear`   | Enable maximum stress testing mode        |  

### Examples  
**Run security audit:**  
```bash
./PoisonIvory.py --config security_config.json --audit
```

**Start continuous monitoring:**  
```bash
./PoisonIvory.py --config security_config.json --monitor
```

**Nuclear stress test:**  
```bash
sudo ./PoisonIvory.py --config security_config.json --audit --nuclear
```

## Design Philosophy  

PoisonIvory embodies three core principles:  

1. **Expert-Centric**  
   - No GUIs, no hand-holding, no "easy mode"  
   - Raw terminal output and JSON reports only  
   - Errors are learning opportunities, not bugs to be automatically fixed  

2. **Infrastructure-Hardened**  
   - Kernel-level optimizations under nuclear mode  
   - Resource-aware operations with process limits  
   - Secure file handling with strict permissions  

3. **Offense-Informed**  
   - Adversary-emulating techniques  
   - Threshold-based automatic countermeasures  
   - Tor circuit warfare capabilities
